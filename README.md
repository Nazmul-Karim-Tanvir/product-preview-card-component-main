### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


 - Some HTML code I'm proud of    


```html
<picture class="product__img">
        <source srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width:600px)">
        <img src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt=" A floral, solar and voluptuous interpretation composed by Olivier Polge,
        Perfumer-Creator for the House of CHANEL.">
      </picture>
```
**In this section , The `picture` tag is used to specify multiple sources for an image, allowing the browser to choose the most appropriate source based on the device's screen size and resolution. The `source` tag specifies the image source for desktop devices with a minimum width of 600px, while the `img` tag specifies the image source for mobile devices. The `alt` attribute provides a description of the image. This code allows for responsive design and improved user experience.**
<hr>

```html
<div class="flex-group">
          <p class="product__price">
            <span class="visually-hidden"> Current price:</span>
            $149.99
          </p>
          <p class="product__original-price">
            <span class="visually-hidden"> Old price:</span>
            <s>$169.99</s>
          </p>
        </div>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
